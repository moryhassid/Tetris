# Tetris
My tetris game


In the illustration below, we see a tetris puzzle,
with the corresponding list with the values.

at beginning the all `heights_per_width_slices` initialed to 600 each cell.

We update the `heights_per_width_slices` according to the state of the tetris bricks.

Using the list we can easily understand what is the maximum height in each slice.

I'd like to find out what is the full row, and after finding our I should remove the complete row.
As seen in the illustration below:
